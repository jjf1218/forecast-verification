    "## Dichotomous Forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, these are forecasts that are either \"yes\" or \"no\". These types of forecasts include whether or not a tornado will form, whether or not it will rain, whether or not fog will be present before 10:00 am, etc. The possibilities are endless. The forecaster only has two options, \"yes, this event will happen\" or  \"no, this event will not happen.\" Similarly, the verification has only two options: \"yes, this event happened\" or \"no, this event did not happen.\" Recalling basic probability dictates that there are four options, which can be organized in what is known as a contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|              |  Forecasted Yes |     Forecasted No    |\n",
    "|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Verified Yes |     A: Hits     |       B: Misses      |\n",
    "|  Verified No | C: False Alarms | D: Correct Negatives |\n",
    "\n",
    "When a forecaster correctly predicts \"yes\" to an event happening, this is known as a \"hit.\" When a forecaster predicts \"no\" to an event happening, this is known as a \"miss.\" If a forecaster says an event will happen, but the event doesn't happen, this is termed a \"false alarm.\" The most frequent category for a forecaster is when a forecaster says an event will not happen, and the event does not happen; this is a \"correct negative.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information in place, different verification scores can be calculated to \"measure\" how well a forecaster predicts certain events happening. Of course, these calculations are basic arithmetic, so they can be done with pencil, a paper and a calculator. But programming makes it easier to quickly look at multiple different scores at once; and should you use these emtrics to compare forecasters against one another, the calculations start to add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a few basic definitions and scores in the next section.\n"
